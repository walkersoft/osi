# OSI Color Reference Manager

## Foreword

This website was for a CIS programming project course at Kishwaukee College. It is 
the first piece of software created by myself and used in a professional 
environment. Development of the software was abondoned years ago and the software was taken offline
in 2020. The website was up for close to 7 years and was used by a group of about 
10 individuals in varying frequency.

Despite the praises from my co-workers, and receiving an A on the 
project, from a design perspective it is arguably one of the 
worst pieces of software I've created and shipped.  I'm proud to have it under my
belt as a reminder of where I started and contrast it to where I am now as a developer.
