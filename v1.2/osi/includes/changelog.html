<span class="chlogBigTitle">Previous Versions</span> <br />

<span class="chlogTitle">v1.1.1 - Released: July 18, 2013</span>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug introduced in v1.1 that prevented the color editor from being displayed to any user with the "Edit Color" permission setting.</li>
	<li>Fixed regular expression handling of searches using a "/" in the query pattern.</li>
</ul>

<span class="chlogTitle">v1.1 - Released: July 10, 2013</span>
<ul>
	<li>Added export functionality for .CSV and .HTML files when browsing colors by manufacturer.  This feature was previously available but could only be achieved using the advanced search.</li>
	<li>Implemented a custom sorting and scoring solution for search results based on keyword relevancy.  In certain cases some searches that would return many results (e.g. "white") would have records sorted in an arbitrary manner.  The new sorting technique will attempt to place more relevant results near the top of the list when displaying on screen.</li>
	<li>Modified the search algorithm to be more inclusive with short keywords.  Certain keywords containing three characters or less would not always return records that should have been included with the results.</li>
	<li>Fixed a discrepancy in the code generated in HTML exports causing the document to fail passing W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional validation.</li>
	<li>Indentified and fixed minor bugs.</li>
